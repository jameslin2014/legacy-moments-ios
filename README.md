# Moments

Moments is an application that [Douglas Bumby](http://www.github.com/istx25) dreamt up early in the morning on Friday, November 28th. Since those few days I have pitched my idea to [Colton Anglin](http://www.github.com/colton) and we decided to make this product together as fast as possible, and work on fixing minor bugs and user interface improvements to the end.

## The Idea

We're wanting Moments to be:
> A platform to allow users to record 15 second blurbs throughout their day and in real time push these feeds to subscribers. Like Snapchat Stories, and YouTube simplified and more accessible.
