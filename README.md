# Moments

Moments is an application that [Douglas Bumby](http://www.github.com/istx25) dreamt up early in the morning on Friday, November 28th. Over the last month I have pitched and got [Damon Jones](http://www.github.com/damonjones) and [Evan Dekhayser](https://github.com/edekhayser) to help in the development of the product and [George Streten](https://twitter.com/gstreten) to help with public relations.

## The Idea

We're wanting Moments to be:
> A platform to allow users to record 15 second blurbs throughout their day and in real time push these feeds to subscribers. Like Snapchat Stories, and YouTube simplified and more accessible.
